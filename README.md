# Board Game Info
## Setting up the board:
- ***Four rearrangeable board sections***
- Each player has a rank. Use name for identification, or playerNum. Depends on XML!
- Each player starts with ***rank of 1*** in the Trailers. (setRoom(SubRoomClass))
- Shuffle deck and deal one card to each set on the board, face down. Each card is a scene.
- ***Ten*** sets on the board, ***40*** scene cards.
- Depending on where each scene is shooting, it might require ***1, 2, or 3*** shots to finish. On each set, place a "shot marker"
on each of the numbered circles. You will remove these markers as you complete shots.


## Setup for Different Group Sizes:
- If there are ***2 or 3 players***, play only ***3 days***
- If there are ***4 players***, there are no changes
- If there are ***5 players***, start each player with ***2 credits***
- If there are ***6 players***, start each player with ***4 credits***
- If there are ***7 or 8 players***, rather than the credits listed above, ***start everyone with a rank of 2.***

Your Goal
---
- Game lasts four days
- Score the most points at the end
- Score will be a combination of your money, your credits, and five times your rank.

Perform A Turn
---
On your turn, you can do the following:
- **Move:** if you are not working on a role, you can move one step and/or take a role. Both of these actions are optional.
- **Work:** if you are working on a role, you must either act (roll a die) or rehearse (take a rehearsal chip),
You must either act or rehearse, because you can't walk off a role once you are on it.
- **Upgrade:** CAN ONLY BE IN CASTING OFFICE, you can pay to raise your rank. You may do this before or after your move

Moving and Taking
---
**Moving (optional)**: If you are not working, you can move. Move from one area to any adjacent area, through any connection, such as
stepping from the Trailers to the Saloon. You can take a role on the same turn, but you don't work on it yet.

**Taking a Role**: take a role by "standing" on a role, if you don't want to take a role, stand in blank area of set. 
Multiple layers can work on same scene, but not on the same role.

There are two types of roles. Roles printed on the board are extras, 
who are working “for scale.” Roles printed on the cards are starring roles, who are working for a 
“piece of the action.” The two types of roles are similar in some ways, 
and different in others, as described in the next section.
You can only work on roles that are equal to or lower than your rank. 
As a general rule, high-numbered roles pay better than lower ones. 
But not always.
Sometimes it’s better to work on scenes with other players, and sometimes it’s better to work alone. 

Working on a Role:
---
Working on roles is how you earn credits and money. 

Every film has a budget between 2 and 6 million dollars. This number dictates two things: how difficult the scene will be to complete, and how much money the movie will pay out. It turns out that big-budget movies are harder to complete. Who knew? 

When working on a role, you have two choices: you can act, or rehearse. (Again, you can’t leave until the scene is done.) 

**Acting**: Acting means performing your role, or at least try-ing to. For this, you earn money and/or credits.

To act, roll one 6-sided die and compare it to the budget of the movie. If you roll equal to or higher than the budget of the movie, you succeed. If you roll lower than the budget of the movie, you fail.

The rewards for success and failure depend on whether you are working on or off the card:
 - On the Card: When you succeed, remove a shot counter and take two credits. When you fail, you get nothing. 
 - Off the Card: When you succeed, remove a shot counter and take one dollar and one credit. When you fail, you still take a dollar. Usually, extras earn more while they work, but less when the scene finally wraps.
 
Moving Along: Every set has one, two, or three shots. These shots must be completed before the scene is wrapped. When you succeed, remove one shot counter from the set; when you remove the last one, you have wrapped the scene.

**Rehearsing:** Instead of acting, you can rehearse. In this case, you do not roll and you do not earn anything. 
To rehearse, add one “practice chip” to your die, stacking it on top or to the side. A practice chip gives you +1 to all die rolls that you make while acting on this role. 
You can accumulate several practice chips if you want, one with each rehearsal, until you reach a point of guaranteed success. At this point, you have to act. 
Hint: Because you have +1 for every chip, acting gets easier if you rehearse first. The chips remain through multiple shots, so rehearsal is extra-powerful on multi-shot sets. 

It's a Wrap!
---
When the last shot in a scene is finished, the scene wraps and you remove the card. You also pay out bonus money, but only if there was at least one player working on the card.
_Bonuses for On-Card Roles:_ The active player rolls a number of dice equal to the budget of the movie (for example, 4 dice for a $4 million movie.) These dice are distributed among the roles on the card, with the highest die going to the top role, the next die going to the next role, and so on. 
This wraps around so, for example, on a $6M card with three roles, the fourth highest die goes to the top role, the fifth to the second role, and the sixth to the third role. 
The players who were working on these roles receive dollars equal to the dice assigned to those roles. Below is an exam-ple payout for a $5 Million movie. 
_Bonuses for Off-Card Roles:_ When money dice are rolled, all extras on that scene receive a bonus equal to the size of the role they are on. So, an extra working on a rank-2 role (regardless of his own rank) makes a bonus of $2.
If there was no one on the card, there is no bonus payment when the scene wraps. This means that extras will only earn their bonus cash when there was someone on the card.
